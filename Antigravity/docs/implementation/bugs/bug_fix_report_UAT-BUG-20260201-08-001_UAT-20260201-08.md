## 2. REPRODUCE STEPS

1. **Environment**: Local development environment
2. **Date**: 2026-02-01
3. **Steps**:
   - Examined the menu structure in `lib/menu-list.ts`
   - Verified the order of menu groups
   - Confirmed that all required groups are present

**Log/Evidence**: 
- Menu structure now contains 9 groups as required by the Handover Document
- Groups are present: Dashboard, CRM, Sales, Service, Insurance, Parts, Accounting, Master Data, Admin
- Groups are in the correct order
- No missing groups identified

---

## 3. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA)

**Root Cause**: The menu structure in `lib/menu-list.ts` previously did not include the CRM and Parts groups as required by the Handover Document (CR-20260201-005).

**File/Module**: `lib/menu-list.ts` (lines 72-410)

**Conditions**: 
- Original implementation followed UI Spec v1.5 (7 groups)
- Handover Document required 9 groups (including CRM and Parts)
- Specification conflict was resolved by implementing the Handover requirements

---

## 4. SCOPE FIXED

**FE**: ✅ Navigation menu structure (`lib/menu-list.ts`)
**BE**: ❌ No change needed
**API**: ❌ No change needed  
**DB**: ❌ No change needed

---

## 5. FILES CHANGED

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `lib/menu-list.ts` | Previously Modified | Added CRM group at position 2 and Parts group at position 6 |

---

## 6. FIX SUMMARY

**Fix**: The menu structure in `lib/menu-list.ts` was previously updated to include the missing CRM and Parts groups in the correct positions as specified in the Handover Document.

**Changes Made**:
1. Added CRM group at position 2 (after Dashboard, before Sales)
2. Added Parts group at position 6 (after Insurance, before Accounting)
3. Maintained all existing menu items and their functionality
4. Ensured proper order of all 9 groups as required

**Original** (7 groups):
```
1. Dashboard
2. Sales
3. Service
4. Insurance
5. Accounting
6. Master Data
7. Admin
```

**Fixed** (9 groups):
```
1. Dashboard
2. CRM
3. Sales
4. Service
5. Insurance
6. Parts
7. Accounting
8. Master Data
9. Admin
```
