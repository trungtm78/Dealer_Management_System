## 📋 Overview

### Purpose
This document defines User Acceptance Testing (UAT) scenarios for the Part-Vehicle Compatibility feature, designed to verify the implementation meets business requirements from an end-user perspective.

### Scope
UAT will cover:
- Individual part compatibility management via dialog
- Batch compatibility management via matrix view
- Parts filtering by vehicle model
- Universal parts behavior
- Validation rules and error handling

### UAT Environment
- **Environment**: UAT (uat.honda-spice.com)
- **Database**: uat_db (latest migration applied)
- **Test Users**:
  - `uat_admin@honda.com` (Admin role - full access)
  - `uat_parts_manager@honda.com` (Parts Manager - read only on compatibility)

### Test Data Requirements
- At least 10 existing parts in the system
- At least 5 active vehicle models (City, Civic, Accord, CR-V, HR-V)
- At least 2 inactive vehicle models (for negative testing)
- Mix of universal parts and parts with specific compatibility

## 📝 UAT Execution Instructions

### Before Starting UAT

1. **Verify UAT Environment**
   ```bash
   # Check migration status
   npm run db:migrate:status --env=uat

   # Verify test data exists
   # Should have at least 10 parts and 5 vehicle models
   ```

2. **Test Users**
   - Create `uat_admin@honda.com` (Admin role)
   - Create `uat_parts_manager@honda.com` (Parts Manager role)

3. **Test Data Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Create test parts if needed
   INSERT INTO parts (part_number, name, category, quantity, status) VALUES
     ('P-UAT-001', 'UAT Test Part 1', 'Consumables', 100, 'ACTIVE'),
     ('P-UAT-002', 'UAT Test Part 2', 'Accessories', 50, 'ACTIVE');

   -- Ensure vehicle models exist
   -- Some ACTIVE, some INACTIVE
   ```

### During UAT

1. **Use Test Execution Log**
   - Record each test case result
   - Note any issues or defects
   - Take screenshots of failures

2. **Defect Reporting**
   - For failed tests, create bug reports in issue tracker
   - Include: TC ID, Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual, Screenshots

### After UAT

1. **Compile Results**
   - Calculate pass/fail rate
   - Identify critical issues
   - Prepare UAT Report

2. **UAT Decision**
   - **PASS**: Ready for production deployment
   - **PASS WITH CONDITIONS**: Minor issues to be fixed post-deployment
   - **FAIL**: Critical issues must be fixed before deployment
