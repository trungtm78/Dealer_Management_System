## 2. Test Execution Metrics
| Category | Metric |
|----------|--------|
| Total Test Cases | 14 |
| Passed | **14** |
| Failed | **0** |
| Pass Rate | **100%** |

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

### ✅ Component Functionality (100% Pass)

- **Infinite Scroll**: Cursor-based pagination ✓
- **Context Filtering**: companyId, onlyActive enforcement ✓
- **Create In-Place**: Dynamic creation flow ✓
- **Race Condition Handling**: RequestId system verified ✓
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys, Enter, Esc ✓

### 🟡 Integration Coverage (Partial)
- **Demo Environment**: Fully functional (tested with Vehicle Models)
- **Production Forms**: **Not Verified** (Quotation Form still uses legacy component)

## 4. Key Findings

### Strengths
1. ✅ **Component Stability**: All 14 test cases passed without errors
2. ✅ **Technical Implementation**: Meets all FR-SYS-001 specifications
3. ✅ **Performance**: Debounce, pagination, and race condition handling work perfectly
4. ✅ **UX Quality**: Odoo-like behavior achieved

### Known Limitations (Out of Scope for Component UAT)
1. 🟡 **Migration Gap**: Quotation Form (`/sales/quotation`) not migrated to SmartSelect
2. 🟡 **API Coverage**: `/api/shared/search/customers` endpoint not yet created
3. 🟡 **Scope Mismatch**: CR deliverable was "Create Component", not "Migrate All Forms"

**Note**: The migration gap is tracked separately as **MIG-001** (AutocompleteFK → SmartSelect Migration).

## 5. Defect Analysis

### No Component Bugs Found
The UAT execution found **zero defects** in the SmartSelect component itself.

### Integration Observation (Not a Component Bug)
| Observation ID | Description | Category | Status |
|----------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **BUG-20260204-001** | Quotation Form not migrated to SmartSelect | Migration Scope | OPEN (Separate from Component UAT) |

**Classification**: This is a **migration/integration issue**, not a component defect. The component works correctly when used; the issue is that existing forms haven't been updated to use it yet.

## 6. Conclusion

The **Smart Search Component (SmartSelect)** has successfully passed UAT verification with a 100% pass rate. All specified functionality works as designed.

**Component Acceptance**: ✅ **ACCEPTED**
**Recommendation**: Approve component for production use. Address form migration separately via Migration CR.
