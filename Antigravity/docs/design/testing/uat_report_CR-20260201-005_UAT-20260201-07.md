|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | 1 | UAT-BUG-20260201-07-001 | Navigation Order Incorrect (Insurance in wrong place, extra menus present). |

**Key Themes**:
1.  **Functional Success**: The new "Create" forms for Insurance are fully functional and validated.
2.  **UI Compliance Fail**: The Navigation Sidebar does not match the strict order defined in UI Spec v1.5.

## 3. TRACEABILITY & COMPLIANCE

| Requirement | Implementation Status | Comment |
|-------------|-----------------------|---------|
| **Insurance Create** | ✅ PASSED | Forms implemented correctly. |
| **Menu Reorder** | 🔴 FAILED | "Insurance" is at bottom. "CRM" and "Phụ Tùng" are cluttering the menu. |

## 4. CONCLUSION
The core functionality (Forms) is ready, but the Deployment cannot be accepted due to the UI regression/non-compliance in Navigation.
