# BRD Update: Master Data (CR-20260202-002)

## 1. Scope Update
- **Enhanced Master Data Management**: Explicitly including the requirement for comprehensive UI management of secondary auxiliary data (Colors, Versions, internal HR structures, etc.) to reduce dependence on manual database operations or hardcoded values.
- **Goal**: Empower Admin users to manage *all* reference data used in transactional modules (Sales, Service, HR).

## 2. Business Value
- **Flexibility**: Marketing can launch new "Colors" or "Editions" without IT deployment.
- **Accuracy**: HR can restructure Departments without code changes.
- **Speed**: Procurement can onboard new Suppliers and manage contracts directly.
